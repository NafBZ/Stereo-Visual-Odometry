# Stereo Visual Odometry

This repo contains an implementation of stereo visual odometry algorithms for road vehicles. For experimental evaluation and validation KITTI dataset has been used.

> To visualise the groud truth pose of the camera run the following commands

```
$ cd scripts/ 
$ python3 visual_odometry.py
```
### You will get a 3D output like this
